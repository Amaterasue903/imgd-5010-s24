# IMGD 5010 Fundamentals: Creative Coding

## Motivation
IMGD graduate students often need background in coding to complete projects for their MS, MFA, or PhD program. While some students arrive at WPI with this background, other students do not, and instead arrive with expertise in modeling, narrative, cultural theory, audio, or other disciplines that collectively inform "IMGD". This course will provide scaffolding to help students explore their own technical challenges. 

"Creative Coding" has become a popular methodology for teaching artists programming; at the same time, it is now a discipline with over fifty years of lineage (like computation itself). This makes it both a methodology and a discipline worthy of study and practice. This course will provide an opportunity to explore the aesthetics of creative coding, and to learn some of the cultural and technical history that inform it.

## Goals
Students will leave this course:
- with a technical understanding of how to code in creative contexts
- with an understanding of the history and aesthetics of programming more generally
- with exposure to a variety of creative coding contexts (frameworks, tools, libraries, engines etc.)
## Schedule (subject to change)

Week 1: What is data? What is programming?
