# IMGD 5010 Fundamentals: Creative Coding

- Instructor: [Charlie Roberts](https://charlie-roberts.com)
- Meetings: Online, synchronous, M-Th 5-6:20 PM PST
- Office Hours: Tuesday 3-5 PM PST or by appointment 

Important note: this syllabus is subject to change, however, I will not change anything that could affect grades.

## Motivation
IMGD graduate students often need background in coding to complete projects for their MS, MFA, or PhD program. While some students arrive at WPI with this background, other students do not, and instead arrive with expertise in modeling, narrative, cultural theory, audio, or other disciplines that collectively inform Interactive Media & Game Development. This course will provide scaffolding to help students explore their own technical challenges. 

"Creative Coding" has become a popular methodology for teaching artists programming; at the same time, it is now a discipline with over fifty years of lineage (like computation itself). This makes it both a methodology and a discipline worthy of study and practice. This course will provide an opportunity to explore the aesthetics of creative coding, and to learn some of the cultural and technical history that inform it.

## Goals
Students will leave this course:
- with a technical understanding of how to code in creative contexts
- with an understanding of the history and aesthetics of programming more generally
- with exposure to a variety of creative coding contexts (frameworks, tools, libraries, engines etc.)

## Grades
- 30% Project(s)
- 40% Assignments (including readings and coding / art sprints)
- 30% Participation

Projects and assignments are, for the most part, graded on completion; if you completed the requirements you will receive a 100%. In a fully online course, participation becomes more important. You can participate in many ways:

- Participating during in-class discussions
- Participating in backchannel conversation during meetings (within reason), please use the Discord server for this, not Zoom chat, so that the conversation is preserved. There will be a dedicated channel for this in the course server.
- Participating in discussion outside of course meeting times via asynchronous communication in the Discord server. Help your fellow classmates with questions / problems they might have!
- Presenting brief talks on artworks / artists you find interesting; everyone will be required to do this at least once during the course.

## Using "AI" for assignments / projects
Short but sweet: don't do it! This is a chance for you to learn the fundamentals of programming, but it's not going to happen if you let generative AI code for you. After this course you'll be in a good position to both let llms assist you in programming and to also understand the code they generate for you. But, even then, I'd still say---as unethical corporations headed by unethical people steal our creative output to train their models while tipping the climate further towards disaster---just don't do it.

## Office Hours
Open office hours are Tuesday 3-5 PM PST in the course Discord server (there will be a dedicated channel). Feel free to stop in and discuss:

- your/my/our research
- technical problems in assignments / projects
- clarifying any course content
- cool creative coding projects you've found

If that time doesn't work for you, please reach out to me via direct message in Discord to setup another time to meet!

## Accomodations
I am *more than happy* to work with you to get the most out of this course; just reach out to me if you have concerns about your ability to complete assignments. That said, here's the formal text WPI recommends regarding accommodations: 
> Students with approved academic accommodations should plan to submit their accommodation letters through the Office of Accessibility Services Student Portal.  Should you have any questions about how accommodations can be implemented in this particular course, please contact me as soon as possible.  Students who are not currently registered with the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS) but who would like to find out more information about requesting accommodations, documentation guidelines, and what the accommodated interactive process entails should plan to contact OAS either by email:  AccessibilityServices@wpi.edu, by phone (508) 831-4908, or by stopping by the office on the 5th floor of Unity Hall.
